# Mission (lite)

Bring FisioRAG to a usable state for stakeholders:
- The platform boots locally with one command (DB + backend + frontend)
- Branch `main` creato; consolidamento tramite PR #7, #8, #9
- Users can login and access the chat screen
- Codebase is consolidated on main with production-ready Docker and security rules
